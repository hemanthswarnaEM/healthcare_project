Hospital Length of Stay Prediction
This project aims to predict the length of stay for patients admitted to hospitals using machine learning techniques. The model utilizes various patient attributes and medical data to estimate the duration of hospitalization.

Dataset
The dataset contains the following key features:

Demographic information (age, sex, height, weight)

Comorbidities

Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, temperature)

Laboratory test results (WBC, RBC, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, etc.)

Other clinical measurements

Models
Several machine learning models were implemented and evaluated:

Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
